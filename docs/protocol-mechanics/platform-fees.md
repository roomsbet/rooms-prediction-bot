# Platform Fees

## Fee Structure

ROOMS uses a transparent, fair fee structure:

- **Protocol Fee:** 2% - Platform operations and development
- **Host Fee:** 1% - Room creator reward
- **Total Fee:** 3% - Deducted from winning payouts only

## How Fees Work

Fees are only charged on **winning bets**:

- **You win** → 3% fee deducted from your payout
- **You lose** → No fees (you just lose your bet)

### Example

**Room Pool:** 100 SOL  
**You bet:** 10 SOL on YES  
**YES wins!**

**Calculation:**
- Your share: 10 SOL / 50 SOL (YES pool) = 20%
- Winning pool: 50 SOL
- After fees: 50 SOL × 97% = 48.5 SOL
- Your payout: 20% × 48.5 SOL = **9.7 SOL**
- Your profit: 9.7 SOL - 10 SOL = **-0.3 SOL**
