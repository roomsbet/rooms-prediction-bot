# Economics & Fees

## Fee Structure

ROOMS uses a transparent, fair fee structure designed to balance platform sustainability with user profitability:

- **Protocol Fee:** 2% - Platform operations, oracle infrastructure, development, and security
- **Host Fee:** 1% - Room creator reward for market creation
- **Total Fee:** 3% - Deducted from winning payouts only

## Economic Model

The ROOMS economic model is designed around three core principles:

**User-First** - Fees only charged on winnings, not losses. Users never pay fees when they lose.

**Sustainability** - 2% protocol fee covers infrastructure costs while maintaining competitive rates.

**Incentive Alignment** - 1% host fee rewards market creators, encouraging quality room creation and market diversity.

## How Fees Work

Fees are only charged on **winning bets**:

- **You win** → 3% fee deducted from your payout
- **You lose** → No fees (you just lose your bet)

This ensures users never pay fees unless they're profitable, making ROOMS accessible to all bettors regardless of size.

### Detailed Example

**Room Setup:**
- Room Pool: 100 SOL total
- YES Pool: 50 SOL (5 users betting 10 SOL each)
- NO Pool: 50 SOL (5 users betting 10 SOL each)
- You bet: 10 SOL on YES

**Settlement:**
- YES wins!
- Total fees: 50 SOL × 3% = 1.5 SOL
- Payout pool: 50 SOL - 1.5 SOL = 48.5 SOL

**Your Payout:**
- Your share: 10 SOL / 50 SOL = 20%
- Your payout: 20% × 48.5 SOL = **9.7 SOL**
- Your profit: 9.7 SOL - 10 SOL = **-0.3 SOL**

In this example, you lost 0.3 SOL due to fees and pool distribution. If the NO pool had been larger (more people betting against you), your payout would have been higher.

## Fee Distribution

## Fee Economics

### Revenue Model

ROOMS generates revenue through protocol fees:

**Volume-Based Revenue:**
- Revenue = Total betting volume × 2% protocol fee
- Scales linearly with platform growth
- Predictable and sustainable

**Example at Scale:**
- 1,000 active users
- Average 10 SOL bet per user per week
- Weekly volume: 10,000 SOL
- Weekly protocol revenue: 10,000 × 2% = 200 SOL
- Annual protocol revenue: 10,400 SOL

### Cost Structure

**Fixed Costs:**
- Infrastructure hosting: ~50 SOL/month
- Oracle API costs: ~30 SOL/month
- Security and compliance: ~20 SOL/month
- Total fixed: ~100 SOL/month

**Variable Costs:**

- Solana network fees: Negligible (~0.000005 SOL per transaction)
- Oracle polling costs: Scale with number of active markets

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Break-even at ~5,000 SOL monthly volume
- Profitable at current scale with room for growth
