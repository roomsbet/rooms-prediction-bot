# Claiming Winnings

## Automatic Payouts

Winners receive payouts automatically - no action required!

## How It Works

1. **Market Settles** - Oracle detects condition met or time reached
2. **Winners Determined** - Based on settlement result
3. **Payout Calculated** - Your share of winning pool (minus fees)
4. **SOL Credited** - Automatically added to your wallet balance
5. **Notification Sent** - Push alert with results

## Push Notifications

You'll receive a message like:

```
🎉 Room Settled!

Will SOL reach $165?

Winner: YES
Your bet: YES
Result: WON

💰 Payout: 1.94 SOL
📈 Profit: +0.94 SOL
```

Or if you lost:

```
😔 Room Settled!

Will SOL reach $165?

Winner: YES
Your bet: NO
Result: LOST

📉 Lost: -2.00 SOL
```
