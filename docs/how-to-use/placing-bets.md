## Betting Tips

### Research First

- Understand the asset
- Consider time until settlement
- Look at pool distribution

### Manage Risk
- Don't bet more than you can afford to lose
- Diversify across multiple rooms
- Start small to learn
- Watch pool sizes for better odds

### Timing Matters
- Early bets often get better odds
- Late bets may have worse payouts
- Watch for instant settlements
- Consider time until lock

## Understanding Pools

### YES Pool
- All bets on YES side

- Smaller pool = better odds (if you win)

### NO Pool
- All bets on NO side
- Opposite of YES pool
- Your payout depends on pool size

### Balanced Pools
- Similar YES/NO distribution
- More even payouts
- Less risk/reward

## Bet Limits

Each room has:
- **Minimum Bet** - Usually 0.05 SOL

- **Room Capacity** - Max players (usually 5-10)

## After Placing

## Common Mistakes
