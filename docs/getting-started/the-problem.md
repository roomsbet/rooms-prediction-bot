# The Problem

## Current State of Prediction Markets

Traditional prediction markets suffer from several critical issues that prevent mainstream adoption:

### Slow Settlements
Most prediction markets require manual resolution or rely on slow oracle updates. Users wait hours or even days to know if they've won, creating frustration and reducing engagement.

### Poor User Experience
Complex interfaces, confusing odds, and technical barriers prevent casual users from participating. The learning curve is too steep for most people.

### Limited Market Types
Most platforms only support a handful of market types, restricting what users can bet on. Custom markets are either impossible or require technical expertise.

### Trust Issues
Users don't trust platforms with their funds. Concerns about security, transparency, and fair settlement prevent adoption.

### High Fees
Excessive fees eat into profits, making it unprofitable for small bettors to participate.
